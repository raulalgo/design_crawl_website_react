# The design crawl - React Edition

The design crawl will be an event happening in London on 24th of March 2018, in which students from the Master on Graphic Design and User Interface from Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca will meet for a day with other proffessionals in the industry, in a day full of design and learning.

This is a React version of the website done using the boilerplate [React Rocket](https://github.com/jakemmarsh/react-rocket-boilerplate), which I encourage you to check because it is awesome.
